# Server Info Bot

---

> Script for sending local IP address via Telegram bot

> This Bash script sends the local IP address of the server to Telegram. The script waits 60 seconds before executing to give the system time to fully boot and configure network interfaces.

> This script is convenient for use on a test server, for example, deployed on an old home PC.

## How to use:

- `sudo nano /etc/environment`

```text
SERVER_INFO_BOT_TOKEN="<token>"
SERVER_INFO_BOT_CHAT_ID_1="<chat id>"
SERVER_INFO_BOT_CHAT_ID_2="<chat id>"
```

- `export EDITOR=vim`
- `crontab -e`
- `@reboot . /path/to/bot.sh`
